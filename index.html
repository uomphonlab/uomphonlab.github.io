<p>The <strong>University of Manchester’s Phonetics Laboratory</strong> (AKA the <strong>Phon Lab</strong>) is the research hub for any and all work in acoustic and articulatory phonetics, experimental phonology and sociophonetics at the University of Manchester. The Lab is used by staff and PhD students alike as well as undergraduate- and master&rsquo;s-level dissertation writers and research assistants from the Linguistics and English Language (LEL) department.</p>

<p>Located in room <strong>S1.24</strong> of the <strong>Samuel Alexander building</strong>, the Lab consists of 3 rooms for recording and analysing speech data. Its facilities include a sound-attenuated recording booth, audio and articulatory equipment, as well as several desktop and laptop computers for running experiments and analysing phonetic data. We also have store that includes equipment for that can be used and borrowed by students conducting research and working on assignments in LEL.</p>
